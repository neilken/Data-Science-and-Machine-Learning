# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models: Code Examples and Explanations

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of fundamental machine learning models, designed for both **learning** and **practical reference**. It walks you through the theory behind the models, and provides reproducible code implementations using Python and popular libraries like **NumPy**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**.

Each model includes:
- A **clear explanation** in `explanation.md` that breaks down the core concepts, math, and use cases.
- A **Jupyter notebook** (`.ipynb`) or **Python script** (`.py`) demonstrating end-to-end implementation.
- **Sample data** (real or synthetic) to test the model and visualize results.

This repo is perfect for:
- **Students** learning ML from scratch or reviewing before exams.
- **Developers** brushing up on model implementation and evaluation.
- **Data scientists** who want concise and modular templates for modeling.

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Provide beginner-friendly, explainable ML code examples.
- Promote best practices in model implementation and evaluation.
- Bridge theory and practice with visual explanations and documentation.
- Support reusable code with modular utilities and consistent structure.
